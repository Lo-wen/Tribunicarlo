He was born on November 24, 1913 in the rural farm of Mangusmana, near the town of Binalonan, Pangasinan, Philippines. In 1930 he immigrated to America where he endured racism and discrimination and was forced to take low-wage jobs. Despite the obstacles, Bulosan became a leader of the Filipino-American community and helped to organize labor unions becoming a prolific author, giving a voice to his people. He never returned to the Philippines and spent most of his life in America. <br>

				He is known for his non-fiction stories. His books and poems bore unsparing witness to the racism and hardships Filipinos encountered in their adopted home. 
				The discrimination and unhealthy working conditions Carlos had experienced in many of his workplaces encouraged him to participate in union organizing with other Filipinos and various workers. Carlos become a self-educated and prolific writer determined to voice the struggles he had undergone as a Filipino coming to America and the struggles he had witnessed of other people. Like many of his fellow Filipinos in his time, Carlos never had the opportunity to return to the Philippines. After years of hardship and flight, he passed away in Seattle suffering from an advanced stage of bronchopneumonia. He is buried at Queen Anne Hill in Seattle. <br>

		they all went away"</h3>
